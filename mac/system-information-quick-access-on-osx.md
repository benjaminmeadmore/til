# Quickly access System Information on macOS

## macOS Sonoma (version 14) 

On all machines running macOS (previously OS X) it is possible to quickly gather system information from thr Apple icon in the top left-most corner of the menu bar. Clickng this reveals a number of options, with the first called _About This Mac._ 

From here, if the `More Info` option is selected, redirecting the user to the General tab in the System Settings menu, and from there `System Report` is chosen, the user can access all hardware, network and software information about their device. Handy, right.  

However, if instead of clicking on _About This Mac_ immediately, you hold down the `option` key this option transforms into _System Information._ This gives the user a direct means for accessing the system report on their device in two steps rather than four.
