The plugin defines several aliases, such as:

- `st` : opens Sublime Text. If passed a file or directory, Sublime Text will open it.
- `stt` : open Sublime Text on the current directory.
- `sst` : if sudo is available, `sst` will open Sublime Text with root permissions, so that you can modify any file or directory that you pass it. Useful to edit system files.
